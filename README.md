# Converging-sort
A diffferent sorting technique

It could be described as a recursive bi-selection sort. I designed it during 2011 when I was studying 2nd year B.E.

Converging Sort.pdf - It is the scanned copy of the initial paper. Thanks to CamScanner.
It has the explanation, pseudo-code, program in C, and time-complexity analysis.

Converging Sort.c - It has the working code in C, improvised in March 2020.

Feel free to share your suggestions.
